## Overview

For this assignment, I created a simple employee directory with React. Upon load, it fakes an employee directory by importing a list of people from randomuser.me. Once on the page, the user is able to search by first name, last name, or email address to find the person they're looking for. The list of employees renders dynamically as you type, helping the user narrow down their search. The information about the employees provided to the user include a profile image (for when you need to match a face to the name!), phone number, email, and date of birth (to help plan those fun office parties!).
